 Title: A Comprehensive Overview of Large Language Model Programming Abstractions: Utilities, Reliability, Performance, Portability, and Extensibility

Authors: [Your Name], [Another Author], [Third Author]

Abstract: In recent months, a multitude of large language model (LLM) programming abstractions have emerged, enabling developers to easily harness the power of LLMs to automate tasks. However, with so many frameworks available, it can be challenging for developers to understand their features and choose the most suitable one for their use case. In this article, we present a 7-layer model of abstraction to classify existing libraries and delineate the separation of concerns that have been observed. We then examine five categories of frameworks in terms of their intrinsic and extrinsic features, namely, utilities/libraries/ecosystem, reliability, performance, portability, and extensibility. By providing a clear picture of these recent developments, we hope to aid developers in making informed decisions about which LLM programming abstraction best suits their needs.

1. Introduction

* Briefly introduce the importance and growing popularity of large language models (LLMs) in various applications, including automating repetitive tasks, data processing, and generating creative content.
* Mention the emergence of numerous LLM programming abstractions, making it difficult for developers to understand their features and choose the most appropriate one for their use case.
* Introduce the objectives of the article: presenting a 7-layer model of abstraction, examining five categories of frameworks, and offering insights into existing work through the lens of these features.

2. Background & Motivation

* Discuss the challenges associated with working directly with LLMs due to their complex interaction patterns, lack of reliability and instability, and limited extensibility.
* Introduce the concept of LLM programming abstractions, which provide developers with more structured ways to interact with LLMs and tackle these issues.

3. A 7-Layer Model of Abstraction

* Describe the 7 layers of abstraction: (1) Function Level Abstraction, (2) Model Abstraction, (3) Constraints, (4) Prompts & Interaction Patterns, (5) Community Driven Prompting/Tooling, and (6) Utilities/Libraries/Ecosystem.
* Explain each layer in detail: (1) Abstracting the output of an LLM as a data model with some predefined schema, (2) Abstracting the LLM as a callable function in a programming environment, (3) Limiting the output based on specific criteria to prevent poorly formed or undesirable outputs, (4) String templates or built-in structures, functions, or templates for accomplishing preset tasks such as requesting the LLM to output in a particular schema, (5) Community resources and active community efforts to integrate prompts and tools into a particular framework, and (6) Tools, utilities, or libraries available for each library.

4. Utilities/Libraries/Ecosystem & Reliability

* Discuss the importance of understanding frameworks' features, namely their utilities, libraries, ecosystem, reliability, performance, portability, and extensibility.
* Introduce the category of Utilities/Libraries/Ecosystem: what utility/tools does each library provide? Are there any community resources available for it?
* Explain the importance of reliability in LLM programming abstractions, such as making content more dependable and handling inconsistencies or instability generated by LLMs.

5. Performance & Extensibility

* Describe the importance of understanding frameworks' performance and extensibility features: How efficiently does each framework perform in terms of cost, speed, or quality? How easily is it to extend the functionality of a library?
* Discuss examples of these features, like the ability to regenerate unsatisfactory output (retries), validate generated content against specific criteria (validation), and implement constraints that prevent undesirable outputs.

6. Community-Driven Prompting/Tooling & Utilities

* Introduce the concept of prebuilt prompts and tools: string templates built into frameworks to accomplish some preset tasks, such as requesting an LLM to output in a particular schema.
* Explain the importance of community resources for each library: there is an active community driven effort to integrate prompts and tools into a particular framework.

7. Conclusion & Future Work

* Summarize the article's objectives, which include presenting a 7-layer model of abstraction, examining five categories of frameworks, and providing insights into existing work through the lens of their features.
* Discuss future work, such as extending the analysis to other LLM programming abstractions and exploring new frameworks that emerge.
* Conclude by offering gratitude for feedback and suggestions from Larry Rudolph (Two Sigma), Chris Mulligan (Two Sigma), and Collin Jung (Stanford).
